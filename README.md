# JavisGraphs
A network graph plotting utility based on Javis

**Development**
`cd` into the JavisGraphs directory and `dev .`

**Testing**
`test JavisGraphs`

ToDo:

* Compute node layout based on user's choice - Graph.jl
* ~Add meta function to get_draw() to update CURRENT_* during rendering~
* ~Add API to specify styles on nodes and edges~
* Aggregate styling functions for nodes and edges
* Rename adjacency_graph to adjacency
* ~Solve global layout issue~
* Other random tasks labelled as `ToDo` inside code
* [OBE] ~Make frames argument first for JGraph~
* ~JGraph option to specify graph position~
* Specialised structs for rectangle, circle etc. and other shapes.
* Update examples with new API
* Start with animation API
* Dynamic evolution of graph
